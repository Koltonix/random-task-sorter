# Random Task Sorter (RTS)

## Description
I said I was going to sort through an excel sheet and each week take some projects people were happy to present and sort them evenly across the weeks. But I'm lazy and can program just about. Also I want to go back to Python because why not.

## Information
- Python 3.7

## Details
I'll update this area once I've finished, but my idea is to have all of the data in the csv with each line starting with their name and then all of the data. From there I will collect every bit of data - store it with the name - and then randomly pick x amount per week for y weeks. This will then print nicely into another csv.
