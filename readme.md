# Random Task Sorter (RTS)

## Description
I said I was going to sort through an excel sheet and each week take some projects people were happy to present and sort them evenly across the weeks. But I'm lazy and can program just about. Also I want to go back to Python because why not.

## Information
- Python 3.7

## Details
- All you need to provide is a .csv file in the format as shown below. 
- Then correct the file directory in the code.
- From there you specify the number of weeks.
- **Note:** any excess data is added as NULL at the end; this will be caused due to there being too few projects.

Data Input:
|Name       |Data       |Data       |Data      |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
|Christopher|Project One|Project Two|Project...|

Data Output:
|Name       |Data                   |Data                   |Data                   |
